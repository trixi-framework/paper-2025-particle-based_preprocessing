## Abstract

Obtaining high-quality particle distributions for stable and accurate particle-based simulations poses significant challenges, especially for complex geometries.
We introduce a preprocessing technique for 2D and 3D geometries, optimized for smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and other particle-based methods.
Our pipeline begins with the generation of a resolution-adaptive point cloud near the geometry's surface employing a face-based neighborhood search.
This point cloud forms the basis for a signed distance field,
enabling efficient, localized computations near surface regions.
To create an initial particle configuration, we apply a hierarchical winding number method for fast and accurate inside-outside segmentation.
Particle positions are then relaxed using an SPH-inspired scheme, which also serves to pack boundary particles.
This ensures full kernel support and promotes isotropic distributions while preserving the geometry interface.
By leveraging the meshless nature of particle-based methods,
our approach does not require connectivity information and is thus straightforward to integrate into existing particle-based frameworks.
It is robust to imperfect input geometries and memory-efficient without compromising performance.
Moreover, our experiments demonstrate that with increasingly higher resolution, the
resulting particle distribution converges to the exact geometry.


## Numerical experiments

The numerical experiments presented in the paper use
[TrixiParticles.jl](https://github.com/trixi-framework/TrixiParticles.jl).
To reproduce the numerical experiments, you need to install
[Julia](https://julialang.org/).

The subfolder `code` of this repository contains a `README.md` file with
instructions to reproduce the numerical experiments.
The subfolders also include the input data, result data and scripts for postprocessing.

All numerical experiments were carried out using Julia v1.11.5.
